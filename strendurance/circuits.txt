CIRCUITS 
Here are two methods for training power endurance using circuits:
POINT IT OUT . Have your climbing partner or coach point out holds for you. This requires being familiar with the wall, the holds on the wall and the level of the climber so that you reach the required number of moves or minutes on the wall. If the moves are too hard, each circle will be broken up by too many falls and short sections, while if the moves are too easy you won’t achieve a high   .enough intensity. The climb should last for about 90 to 180 seconds, which is somewhere between 25 and 50 moves, depending on how fast you climb. You should do four to six circles per session with 3 to 5 minutes of rest between each circle.
REDPOINT . Here you can create your own route with defined handholds and footholds. The climbing time should be around 90 to 180 seconds, or 40 to 60 moves. You can also simulate the type of climbing that you are training for. So, if you’re training for a particular route, you can create a circle that simulates both the number of moves and how the sections are put together. For example, if there are three crux sections with rests in between, your circle can reflect this. If the route is more homogeneous with little or no rest, the circle can be created to simulate this. Making these circles yourself is also great training for your technique since you have to test and adjust the moves, handholds, and footholds several times to get it to work. You can vary the sessions by having two to four attempts on very hard circles with a long (over 10 minutes) rest between each attempt, and having slightly easier circles, resting for 3 to 5 minutes with a total of four to six attempts
