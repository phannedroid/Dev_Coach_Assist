THE MCCLURE METHOD 
This method gets its name from British climbing legend Steve McClure, who uses it as one of his exercises to prepare for hard and intense redpoints and on-sights. The exercise is done on the campus board with the legs either on a chair or a foothold, and you go up and down continuously – for example, 1-2-1 or 1-2-3-2-1 – for 60 to 120 seconds. If you manage more than 120 seconds, adjust the foot position to make it more difficult. This is then repeated for five to six sets with a 2- to 3-minute break between each set
