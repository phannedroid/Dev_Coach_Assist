1 x 4 ROUTES 
Here you choose four different routes which are so hard that there is a high chance that you will fall at the top. They should also be as sustained as possible. You should climb until you fall, and the goal is to go all-in on every attempt. Rest for 10 minutes and move on to the next route. If there arenâ€™t enough routes at your climbing wall you can have four attempts on the same route.
