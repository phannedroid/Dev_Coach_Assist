DEADHANGS 
Deadhanging is a simple and effective high intensity endurance training method because we can customise how long the grip and release phases are for each set. To make this training specific enough, we need to look at how long the grip and release phases are when climbing. Observational studies have shown that the average grip phase in competition lead climbing lasts for about 7 seconds. As mentioned earlier, the release phase must last for more than 3 
seconds in order for us to recover during a climb. When we put this together for a deadhang session, it can look something like this:
 Hang time: 7 seconds
 Rest between reps: 3 seconds
 Repetitions: 7
 Sets: 7 to 14
 Rest between sets: 2 minutes
Hanging and resting times are adapted to the grip and release phase during climbing. The goal of the session is to train each set to exhaustion, to the point where the fingers start to open. In order to have progression and variation in your training, you should use different grip positions and edge depths. Start with one session per week and increase to two sessions with a minimum of two days of rest between each session after four to six weeks of exercise. Since these sessions are both load and volume intensive, it is recommended that you donâ€™t combine them with regular climbing in the same session
