LOCK OFF
This is best done on an overhang, the steeper the overhang, the harder this will be. You should do this task for every single move on the route 
LEVEL 1: touch your armpit to your lowest hand (same side only)
LEVEL 2: pull into the lock off position and reach for your next hold
LEVEL 3: pull into the lock of position on your lower arm then take both of your feet off of the holds for 1 second then replace them. 
LEVEL 4: you are going to use a lock off to get to the next hold, you are only allowed one foot on the wall
LEVEL 5: pull into a lock off and take feet off of the wall for 3 second
