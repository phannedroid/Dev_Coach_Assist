ARC (AEROBIC ENERGY 
RESTORATION AND CAPILLARISATION) 
This method is comparable to mellow long distance running. The advantage of this method is that it builds your capacity to endure training and to recover on the wall during a climb, but the disadvantage is that it takes both a long time and is at a level so far below your own maximum level that it might not be very technically demanding. The most rewarding way to train this, we think, is to do lots of easier routes outdoors, for example as an active rest day, as this provides a greater benefit for your technique than a corresponding 
CONTINUOUS 
This training method is aimed at the formation of new blood vessels in the muscles and to build a base for more intensive training. It involves being on the wall continuously for over 10 minutes at a   .sufficiently low intensity so that you do not exceed level 2 on the ‘pump scale’. As your endurance progresses you can continue climbing beyond the initial 10 minutes, but one repetition is enough per session
