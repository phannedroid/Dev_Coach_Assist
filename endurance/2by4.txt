2 x 4 
Choose two routes where the first one is a little harder than the second and lead them one after the other. Done correctly, you should be able to complete the first route by a small margin, with a moderate forearm pump, and you should be able to recover on route two. Repeat in sets of four with a rest period equal to climbing time. If possible, it is good to vary the routes in the sets in order to maximise the variation in your climbing.
