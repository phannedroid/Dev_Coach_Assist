YO-YO 
Climb a route on lead, then down-climb the same route, and then climb back up a second route on top rope. The total time should be 5 to 7 minutes on the wall per set. The difficulty level per route and the number of sets in total determines how hard the session is, but for endurance training, the focus should be on easier routes and more sets. Yo-yo sessions are easier with a climbing partner who is doing the same session as you, so that the rest period is roughly equal to the climbing time. Begin training with two to three sets and increase to five sets before making each route a little harder
