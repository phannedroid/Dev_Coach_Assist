CIRCLES 
Circle training is a popular method based on interval principles. This means periods of work and periods of rest where the intensity per circle, the rest time between the circles and the total number of circles determine how hard the training will be. When endurance training at lower intensities (levels 2 to 3), each circle can be between 4 and 10 minutes long, and involve trying not to get pumped while climbing. Here you can easily insert some harder sections followed by easier sections and a rest so that you get variation through the circle and allow the pump to come and go, a bit like when youâ€™re running in hilly terrain. You can start with two circles per session with a 2- to 3 minute break between each circle and increase both the number of ircles and the time per circle as your endurance improves. The easiest approach is to use a training wall with lots of holds and use any handholds and footholds, but you can also get your training partner to point out which holds to use as you climb
