3 x 5 
Choose three routes that are roughly equally hard and lead them one after the other. Repeat five sets, and adjust the resting period to match the climbing time. If possible, it is good to vary the routes in the sets in order to maximise the variation in your climbing. The goal is to keep the pump at an acceptable level so that you can complete the exercise with only a light to moderate pump. A common mistake is to start too hard; our recommendation is to choose routes that are a tad easier than you think will allow you to complete the session
